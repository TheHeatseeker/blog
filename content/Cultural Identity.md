A strong cultural identity, or the lack thereof, has a subliminal but certain impact on mental health. This effect is only more prominent recently after the globalization of the nations of the world. This forces cultures that would otherwise never recognize each other to collide in what seems to be an instant, compared to the duration for which they have existed prior.

No two cultures exist in tandem, they either 
- **mix and mesh** together and become something remarkably different from the originals, or  
- one **devours & dominates** the other, leaving only one of them standing, or
- they both go **extinct**

However, any such significant change to culture means significant change to the people of that culture, for culture IS people (or, what they do, how they behave, etc.).

And that change to the people en masse  is what deals a sustained, long lasting impact on peoples mental health. 

Cultures dictate behaviors and values people have long put into things, and a shift of culture completely dissolves those value systems. It means what was long considered a morally incorrect behavior is now just a commonplace habit, or virtues of the past are now relics of antiquity in the new era.
